# Deployment Instructions

## Physics Labs
Load on web server. Open index.html in physics labs folder.

## Bridge Builder
* Load on web server like hhscp.org/u/leed/bridge/bridgeBuilder.html
* Open the html file in a computer browser (not mobile)
* To use, draw beams by dragging with the mouse
* The bottom left node is fixed, the middle node has weight applied to it, and the right node is fixed in the vertical direction.
* Edit beam width before dragging beams to give them a different width
* Edit weight to change the stress applied to the bridge
* Press play to run simulation
* When everything turns black, the bridge has reached equilibrium
* Open analysis in another tab by clicking Analyze button
